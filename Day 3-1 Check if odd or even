#Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number. 
#Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder. 
#e.g. 86 is **even** because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

if number % 2 != 0:
  print("The number is Odd")
else:
  print("The number is Even")
